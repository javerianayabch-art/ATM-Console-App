# ATM Console Application (Java)

A simple console-based ATM login system built using Java.  
This project was created while practicing **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts, especially **encapsulation**, and basic user interaction through the console.

## Features
- Account login using account number and password
- Withdraw money with balance validation
- Check current balance
- Change ATM password with basic validation
- Menu-driven console interface

## Concepts Used
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Encapsulation (private fields with getters & setters)
- Classes and objects
- Conditional statements and loops
- Java `Scanner` for user input

## Technologies
- Java
- Console-based application


## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in any Java-supported IDE (VS Code / IntelliJ / Eclipse)
3. Compile and run `ATM.java`

## Purpose
This project was built as a **learning exercise** to strengthen Java fundamentals and understand how real-world systems like ATMs can be modeled using OOP concepts.

## Notes
- This is a beginner-level project
- No database or file handling is used
- Designed for learning, not production use
